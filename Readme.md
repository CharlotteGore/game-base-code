# Game Base Code

I'm not going to insult the internet by calling this an engine. What it is is some fairly useful Three.JS boilerplate:

- A slightly more impressive rendering pipeline that makes it easy to add bloom, glow effects etc.
- Various other libraries related to animation loops, easing etc already imported
- An input aggregator
- An asset loader
- A vaguely useful and performant particle engine
- a vaguely useful and powerful camera control thing
- A text-to-texture thing for creating HUDs etc.

Specific to game stuff, this also contains:

- Blender Quad geometry -> SAT Polygons
- Spatial hash grid
- Example entities / entity management

That's about it.
